#### Creation and Purpose

The tieflings, as they are known today, trace their origins back to the dark days of the Demon War, a period marked by unimaginable horror and strife. The demon lord Ukral, seeking to bolster his infernal legions with more cunning and versatile soldiers, began to experiment with fusing demonic essence with human souls. Through vile sorcery and dark rituals, he created the tieflingsâ€”beings who possessed the physical and magical prowess of demons combined with the intelligence and adaptability of humans.

Initially, these tieflings were bound to Ukral's will, little more than mindless slaves executing his malevolent commands. Their existence was one of torment and subjugation, their free will suppressed by the demonic bindings that shackled their minds.

#### Liberation and Recognition

The tide of the war changed with the rise of [[Thorles Loray]] and his close friend [[Paul Vigil]], the first paladin. Through their leadership and the unity of the human kingdoms, Ukral was ultimately defeated in the climactic battle that marked the end of the Demon War in 0BL (before Loray)
With [[Ukral, Demonlord of Despair]]'s defeat, the enchantments and bindings that held the tieflings in thrall were shattered. Suddenly free from their master's control, these beings found themselves in a world that viewed them with suspicion and fear due to their demonic appearance and origins.

Thorles Loray, recognizing the potential for a new beginning, extended a hand of compassion and understanding to the tieflings. He saw that they, too, had suffered under Ukral's tyranny and deserved a chance to live freely. Under his guidance, the newly-formed Empire of Man granted tieflings citizenship, acknowledging their humanity and the potential for redemption and integration into society.

#### Integration into the Empire

The process of integrating tieflings into the [[RemoteBackup/Organisations and Factions/First Empire Of Man|First Empire Of Man]] was not without its challenges. Prejudices and fears ran deep, and many tieflings faced discrimination and mistrust from those who still saw them as remnants of Ukral's dark legacy. However, the Empire, under the wise and just rule of Thorles Loray, enacted laws to protect tieflings' rights and promote their acceptance.

Tieflings gradually found their place within the Empire, contributing to its reconstruction and growth in various ways. Some became scholars, delving into the arcane arts with a depth of understanding born from their unique heritage. Others served in the military, using their innate abilities to protect the realm that had accepted them. Many more simply sought to live peaceful lives, raising families and contributing to their communities.

#### Legacy and Modern Day

Sixty years have passed since the end of the Demon War and the formation of the First Empire of Man. In 60IA (Imperial Age), tieflings are a recognized and integral part of the Empire's diverse populace. While some pockets of prejudice remain, the majority of the Empire's citizens have come to see tieflings as their fellow men and women, bound by common goals and shared experiences.

The Order of the Paladins, established by Paul Vigil, has been particularly instrumental in fostering acceptance and understanding. Many tieflings have joined the Order, their unique abilities and perspectives enriching its ranks and proving their loyalty and dedication to the Empire's ideals.

Emperor Thorles Loray's legacy of unity and compassion lives on in the Empire's treatment of tieflings, serving as a testament to the belief that even those born of darkness can find their place in the light. The story of the tieflings' liberation and integration stands as a powerful reminder of the Empire's founding principles: that all beings deserve the chance for redemption, and that strength lies in diversity and unity.
