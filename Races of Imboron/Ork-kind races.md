Their existence on the fringes of the empire has led to occasional conflicts with border towns. However, over time, many orcs have sought refuge within the empire, becoming exiles and refugees seeking a new life.

Among these orcish exiles, a significant number have settled in the border town of [[Westholm]]. Here, they have integrated into the empire's society, with some serving as shock troops in the Imperial army, while others embark on their own adventures.

Over the years, the orcish population in Westholm has grown, becoming a vital and influential part of the town's community and the empire's economy. Their diverse skills and unique perspectives have enriched the region, fostering a sense of unity and mutual cooperation between the human and orcish inhabitants.

As for the orc capital in Drorgral Niz, it is known as [[Gromlok Thar]]. This city serves as the heart of orcish culture and tradition, where the various clans convene and the chieftains make important decisions. Gromlok Thar is a place of ancient traditions, fierce battles, and an enduring spirit that binds the orcs of Drorgral Niz together.
