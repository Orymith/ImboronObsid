### History

The history of the Guild of Prosperous Traders dates back to the aftermath of the Celestial Comet, a cataclysmic event that reshaped the landscape of [[Imboron]]Imboron. As the sea receded, revealing the land bridge connecting Astoria and Marisville, ambitious traders saw an opportunity to capitalize on the newfound geographical advantage. These traders, seeking to establish trade routes and foster economic prosperity, formed a loose association that eventually evolved into the Guild of Prosperous Traders. In the early days, the guild was more of a cooperative effort, with merchants pooling resources and sharing knowledge to thrive in the post-comet era. As trade between the [[Bridge City's]]Bridge Cities and neighboring realms flourished, the guild's influence expanded. Its members grew wealthier and more influential, and they began to play an active role in the politics and governance of the cities. Approximately 500 years ago, the guild's ambition reached a tipping point. Dissatisfaction with the oppressive rule of the ruling kings led the guild to orchestrate an uprising, successfully overthrowing the monarchs and establishing an oligarchic rule. From that point forward, the guild wielded considerable political power, governing trade affairs and shaping the economic landscape of the Bridge Cities and [[First Empire Of Man]]
