### Divine Origins

The deity revered by the Suns of Dawn and credited with the creation of the first paladins is known as "Solara, the Radiant Sun." It was at the darkest hour during the Battle of Crescent Hill, in the third year Before Loray (B.L.), that Solara revealed her existence and bestowed her divine blessing upon ten chosen individuals, including Paul Vigil. These newly anointed paladins became the guiding light in the fight against the demonic forces, illuminating the path of dawn and hope for the realm of Imboron.
