#### Early Life and Background

Thorles Loray was born into a humble family in the small village of Hartsfield, located in the heartlands of what would become the First Empire. His parents, farmers of modest means, instilled in him the values of hard work, resilience, and a deep love for the land and its people. From a young age, Thorles demonstrated remarkable leadership qualities and a natural charisma that drew people to him. Despite his commoner status, he earned the respect of his peers and elders alike through his integrity and unwavering determination.

#### Rise to Prominence

As the shadow of the demon lord [[Ukral, Demonlord of Despair]]  began to spread across the land, plunging the human kingdoms into chaos and despair, Thorles emerged as a beacon of hope. Recognizing the need for unity in the face of such a dire threat, he began to travel from village to village, rallying the people and seeking out leaders who would join him in the fight against the demonic invasion.

It was during these early days of resistance that Thorles met [[Paul Vigil]], a warrior of unparalleled skill and a man of unshakeable faith. The two quickly became close friends and confidants, united by their shared vision of a world free from the horrors of demonic oppression. Paul's unwavering belief in the gods and his emerging role as the first paladin inspired countless others to take up arms in the name of [[Solara, the Radiant Sun]]

#### The War Against the Demons

The war against Ukral's demonic legions was long and brutal. Thorles and Paul led their growing army through countless battles, each victory hard-won and costly. Thorles's strategic brilliance and Paul's divine guidance became legendary, inspiring hope even in the darkest of times. Under their leadership, the disparate human kingdoms began to see the value of unity and cooperation, setting aside old rivalries and grudges in the face of their common enemy.

#### The Formation of the First Empire

As the tide of battle began to turn in favor of the humans, Thorles and Paul convened a grand council of kings and chieftains from across the land. In a historic and unprecedented move, the leaders agreed to unify their realms under a single banner, recognizing that only through solidarity could they ensure lasting peace and security.

With the final defeat of Ukral and the sealing of the rifts to the Shattered Abyss, the human kingdoms were united at last. Thorles Loray, whose vision and leadership had made this unity possible, was crowned the first Emperor of the newly formed [[First Empire Of Man]]. [[Paul Vigil]], honoured as the first paladin and Thorles's right hand, was granted a position of great influence and respect within the new order.

#### Reign as Emperor

As Emperor, Thorles Loray dedicated himself to the reconstruction and strengthening of the Empire. He established a system of governance that balanced the needs of the various regions and peoples, promoting justice, prosperity, and peace. His humble origins and deep empathy for his subjects made him a beloved ruler, and his reign became known as a golden age of recovery and growth.

Thorles also worked tirelessly to ensure that the memory of the demon invasion and the sacrifices made during the war would not be forgotten. He established the [[The Suns of Dawn]], with [[Paul Vigil]] as its first High Paladin, to serve as both protectors of the realm and guardians of its history and values.

#### Legacy and the Current Year

In the 60 years since Thorles Loray was crowned Emperor in 0BL (Before Loray), the Empire of Man has flourished. The year is now 60IA (Imperial Age), and the Empire stands as a testament to Thorles's vision and leadership. The stories of his rise from commoner to Emperor and his friendship with Paul Vigil continue to inspire new generations.

[[The Suns of Dawn]] remains a powerful and respected institution, upholding the values of honour, courage, and justice. The Empire, though not without its challenges, enjoys a period of relative peace and stability, its people ever vigilant against the threats that may arise from both within and beyond its borders.
