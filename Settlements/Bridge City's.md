In the realm of [[Imboron]], the Bridge Cities stand as a testament to ambition and prosperity. Once divided by a vast expanse of sea, two flourishing cities, [[Astoria]] and [[Marisville]], expanded relentlessly until both shores were united by a grand causeway—a colossal bridge. Atop the bridge, a bustling metropolis thrives, governed by the influential [[Guild of Prosperous Traders]].The guild, having overthrown the original kings two centuries ago, holds the reins of power and shapes the city's fate. The Bridge Cities are now governed by oligarchs, and while wealth and opportunity abound for some, many inhabitants find themselves ensnared in the clutches of poverty.

### Government

Oligarchs: The Oligarchs, comprising esteemed members of the Guild of Prosperous Traders, are the ruling elite of the Bridge Cities. They are the wealthiest and most influential individuals, holding sway over trade, commerce, and various sectors of the city's economy. 

Council of Oligarchs: The council serves as the primary decision-making body within the guild. The Oligarchs convene to discuss and determine matters of governance, legislation, trade policies, and other significant aspects of city affairs. Guild 

Hierarchy: The [[Guild of Prosperous Traders]] is structured with a hierarchy, where members rise through the ranks based on their achievements, contributions to the guild's prosperity, and wealth. The higher the rank, the greater the influence and privileges bestowed upon them.

### Industry & Trade

1. The Guild of Prosperous Traders: The guild plays a central role in organizing and overseeing trade affairs. Comprising influential merchants, they establish trade routes, negotiate agreements, and ensure fair practices among traders.
2. Strategic Location: Situated at the crossroads of major land and sea routes, the Bridge Cities enjoy a prime geographical position, making them a hub for regional and international trade. Merchants from neighboring realms and distant lands converge here, exchanging goods and ideas. 
3. Diverse Commodities: The Bridge Cities boast a wide array of commodities available for trade. From exquisite fabrics and spices to rare magical artifacts and enchanted crystals, the market caters to the desires and needs of a diverse clientele. 
4. Magical Trade: The cities are renowned for their magical trade, with skilled enchanters and artisans offering their services and creations. Enchanted items, spell scrolls, and mystical artifacts find their way into the hands of wizards, adventurers, and collectors. 
5. The Bridge Metropolis: The bridge itself houses a bustling metropolis of shops, taverns, and market stalls, creating a unique market atmosphere. Traders set up stalls and shops on the bridge's surface, where buyers and sellers converge to strike deals. 
6. Maritime Trade: The sea trade is still an essential aspect of the cities' commerce. Ships dock at the ports of Astoria and Marisville, unloading exotic goods and taking aboard local produce and manufactured goods for export.
7. Commerce and Inequality: While trade brings prosperity to the guild and its members, there is a stark contrast between the wealthy elite and the less privileged inhabitants. The disparity in wealth distribution is a constant challenge, with many residents facing economic hardships. 
8. Trade Regulations: The guild enforces trade regulations to maintain order and prevent unfair practices. Taxes and tariffs are imposed on imports and exports, funding public projects and the guild's activities.

### Districts

The Gateway District: Positioned at either end of the bridge, the Gateway Districts welcome travelers and merchants arriving from neighboring realms. These districts are bustling hubs of commerce and trade, where merchants set up their stalls and shops, offering a myriad of goods from far and wide. The Trade Quarter: Nestled close to the Great Gates, the Trade Quarter is a labyrinth of narrow streets and alleys bustling with traders and customers. Here, commodities from exotic lands are bought and sold, and enchanters display their magical wares to entice curious buyers. The Arcane Enclave: Situated just beyond the Great Gates, the Arcane Enclave is a haven for spellcasters and enchanters. This district houses magical academies, alchemy shops, and arcane libraries, where knowledge of the mystical arts is shared and honed. The Noble District: Past the imposing Great Gates lies the opulent Noble District, home to the wealthiest and most influential inhabitants. Mansions, estates, and luxurious townhouses dot the landscape, a testament to the prosperity of the elite oligarchs and prominent merchants. The Bridge Metropolis: Extending across the length of the bridge itself, the Bridge Metropolis is a vibrant central district teeming with life. This bustling hub features a fusion of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, offering a unique and lively urban experience. The Harbor Quarters: Located near the coastal edges of both Astoria and Marisville, the Harbor Quarters house the bustling ports and shipyards. Here, seafaring merchants and traders unload their cargoes and engage in maritime commerce. The Riverfront District: Flanking the banks of the river that flows beneath the bridge, the Riverfront District is a charming area with waterside cafés, small docks, and boatmen offering scenic river rides. The Bridge's Pinnacle: At the highest point of the bridge, beyond the Great Gates, lies the Bridge's Pinnacle—a spectacular observation deck providing breathtaking views of the cities and the surrounding landscape.

Overthrow of Kings (approx. 500 years ago): The Guild of Prosperous Traders orchestrated an uprising, resulting in the overthrow of the ruling kings and the establishment of an oligarchic rule.

Construction of the Bridge (approx. 400 years ago): As the cities expanded, a grand bridge was constructed to connect Astoria and Marisville, becoming a symbol of their unity and prosperity.
