### History

**Foundation and Early Days (500 BL - 400 BL):** Around 500 years Before Loray, the Jarethi tribe, led by a wise and charismatic chieftain named Jaros, established the settlement that would eventually become Jares. Through his visionary leadership, Jaros united the various Jarethi clans and laid the foundations of a flourishing community. The city began as a humble collection of wooden huts and tents, but it soon grew into a bustling trade hub due to its strategic location along important trade routes.  

**Rise to Prominence (400 BL - 300 BL):** As Jares continued to prosper, it attracted merchants, adventurers, and scholars from neighboring regions and beyond. With its artisans excelling in craftsmanship, the city gained renown for producing fine jewelry, exquisite pottery, and exquisite textiles. Jares became known as the City of Artisans, and its reputation spread far and wide.  

**The Founding of the Kingdom of Jares (300 BL - 150 BL):** In the year 300 Before Loray, the city of Jares witnessed a turning point in its history. Under the guidance of a wise and just ruler named King Tavian, Jares transformed into a formidable kingdom. King Tavian brought stability to the region, establishing a fair legal system and investing in the city's infrastructure. The kingdom flourished under his reign, and Jares became a beacon of culture, knowledge, and prosperity. 

**The Golden Age (150 BL - 50 BL):** The following century marked the Golden Age of Jares. The kingdom experienced unprecedented growth and cultural achievements. The Royal Academy of Jares was founded during this period, attracting scholars, artists, and philosophers from all corners of Imboron. The city's libraries and archives became renowned for their vast collections of ancient texts and invaluable knowledge.   

**Siege of Jares - Year 1 Before Loray:** As the [[Demon Wars]] intensified, the last bastion of human resistance was Jares, a fortified city known for its resilient defenders. The humans fought valiantly, and the orcs of Drognal Niz joined their human allies in this crucial battle. The siege was fierce, but the united forces managed to withstand the demonic onslaught. In a remarkable display of courage and resilience, the mortals achieved their first major victory against the demons, breaking their relentless advance. The Siege of Jares was a pivotal and harrowing event during the Demon Invasion, a dark chapter in the history of Imboron. As the demonic horde swept through the realm, Jares stood as the last bastion of human resistance, fortified by its resilient defenders. 

**The Sealing of the Gates:** At the onset of the siege, the defenders of Jares realized the critical importance of securing their city's entrances. The mighty gates were reinforced, bolstered with enchanted wards and guarded by the city's most skilled warriors. The defenders knew that their survival depended on keeping the demonic forces from breaching the city walls. 

**Endless Night:** During the siege, the demons unleashed a malevolent magic that shrouded Jares in perpetual darkness. The sun was hidden from the sky, replaced by an eerie, blood-red moon that cast a sinister glow over the city. The defenders struggled to find respite in the unending night, their senses tested by the relentless assault of the demonic forces. 

**Terror from Within**: As the siege wore on, whispers spread of a traitor among the defenders. Rumors spoke of a human who had succumbed to demonic temptation, willing to betray their kin for personal gain. This internal threat added an unsettling layer of distrust and paranoia among the already beleaguered defenders, making it difficult to know who could be trusted. 

**The Demon 
Lord's Challenge**: As the siege reached its climax, the demon lord [[Ukral, Demonlord of Despair]] himself appeared before the city's walls. His towering form exuded malevolence, and his eyes burned with a wicked hunger for conquest. With a voice that sent shivers down the spines of even the bravest defenders, Ukral issued a chilling challenge, offering clemency to the city if they surrendered and pledged allegiance to him. However, the defenders knew that such a bargain would bring only doom and enslavement to their realm. 

**The Betrayal and Redemption:** In a shocking turn of events, the traitor was unmasked as a prominent general among the defenders. Fueled by jealousy and envy, he had fallen under the sway of the demonic forces, willing to betray his own people for promises of power. However, on the eve of his treachery, he was visited by the spirit of a fallen comrade, a close friend who had died in the early stages of the siege. This ethereal encounter sparked a flicker of redemption within him, and he chose to atone for his actions. The traitor revealed the demon lord's plan to breach a vulnerable section of the city walls, giving the defenders a chance to bolster their defenses. 

**The Final Battle**: As the demon forces launched their final and most vicious assault, the defenders of Jares fought with an unparalleled ferocity. The battle raged for days, and the city's walls were bathed in demon blood. The defenders, led by their courageous generals and bolstered by newfound unity, stood firm against the malevolent onslaught. 

**The Demonic Retreat:** Finally, on the brink of exhaustion, the demonic horde withdrew from their relentless siege. The defenders of Jares had proved their unwavering resolve, and the demonic forces were forced to concede defeat. The siege had turned from an impending disaster to a momentous victory for the mortal realm. The Siege of Jares stands as a testament to the strength of unity, the power of resilience, and the bravery of those who stand against the darkness. The city of Jares, forever etched in the annals of history, became a symbol of hope and inspiration for future generations, a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming odds, courage and unity can prevail.  

**The Empire of Man (0 IA - 60 IA):** In the year 20 Imperial Age, Jares saw a significant transformation when the city was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Empire of Man. The Emperor [[Thorles Loray]] united the scattered human kingdoms and tribes under a single banner, establishing a powerful empire that spanned the realm of [[Imboron]].
