The Underempire of [[imboron]], built upon the foundations of a Duergar nation, stands as a testament to resistance and resilience. Initially focused on survival, the Underempire now faces a new divide concerning the fate of those above in the [[RemoteBackup/Settlements/BridgeCities/Bridge City's|Bridge City's]]. The parliament is split, tensions rise, and violence looms. This unrest permeates all levels of society, with aggressive guards, distrustful Yuan-ti, and hospitals filled with Soulfire poisoning victims.

### Government

**Parliament:** The primary governing body of the Underempire, comprised of 90 members from noble houses. Elections occur every 20 years, with landowners voting for their preferred candidates. Law changes require discussion and a vote, needing at least 50 Yuan-ti supporters.

**Officeriat:** The military governs the uppermost city level, exposed to monster threats and invasions. Generals, often part of the parliament, rule with an iron fist. They have authority over everyone except higher military ranks or individuals with parliamentary or Berchan immunity. Currently, there are five Officeriats, with the most notable in Upper Fort.

**Berchan:** Once a kingly title, the Berchan role is now symbolic, with most power residing in the parliament. The Berchan can grant immunity and controls the Council Guard, elite guardians of the parliamentary halls.

### Industry and Trade

1. **Underway Yoln Trading Company:** Responsible for transporting raw materials from production villages and processed commodities. They maintain guard posts for protecting transports and VIPs.
    
2. **Great Forges:** Built on Duergar foundations, these forges produce exquisite equipment with delivered ores.
    

### Districts

- **Upper Fort:** Location of the Officeriat. Its small civilian population comprises mostly doctors and military-employed smiths. The Granitium, a notorious fortification for criminal interrogation, stands here.
    
- **Grand Staircase:** The largest district, featuring middle-class housing away from industrial areas. It has a maze-like layout and is heavily guarded but plagued by petty theft and Soulfire poisoning.
    
- **Templehof:** The worship district, home to many temples, ziggurats, and altars dedicated to snake gods.
    
- **Golden Hills:** The district of the most expensive buildings, including the Halls of Parliament, Manor of Berchan, Imperial Zoo, and Zerian Headquarters.
