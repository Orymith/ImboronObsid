In the vast lands of Imbron the underempire is a testament of resistance. Build upon a duregarian nation the great underempire is well fortified and armed however the orignal goal of survival was met and a new divide arises, what shall be done with those above? The parlament is divided and the tension slowly rises and the tension inches closer and closer to riots and viloence. Despite the conflict originating in high soceiety the tension is felt everywhere as more and more guards act harsh and agressive, Yuan ti grow even more distrustfull and Hospitals overfill with victims of Soulfire poisoning.

Goverment

Parliment: the main govening body of the underempire is the parliment comprised of 90 members all from noble houses every 20 years there is an election where everyone who owns land can vote on their favoured candidate any changes in law have to be discussed and voted on by the parliment with at least 50 yuan ti supproting it.

Officeriat: despite the main goverment being the parliment military has a direct control of the uppermost level of the city expsed to monsters and threat of invasion generals are usually part of the parliment so officers rule with iron fist, they have the authority over everyone with exception of higher ranks in military or people given immunity by the parliment or by the Berchan, now only 5 oficeriats exist the most notable one on the upper level of Yoln but more are set up in most dangeros parts of the underempire fronteer

Berchan: originally a title of a king of the yuan ti nation now this role is more symbolic as most rulling comes from the parliment, despite that his role is proteced by law and he has some privileges over everyone in the empire. He is free to give out immunity marks to all people not currenly chased by law and he is in direct control of the councill guard (elite guardians of the halls of parliment)

# Districts 

Upper Fort the location of the Officeriat its population is small especially after the sewers were opened the small civilan population is comprised mostly of doctors and smiths working for the military. Long since the homes here were dimantled and replaced with fortifications and watchtowers at the centre of it over the grand staircase stands the Granitium a fortification where the officers live it gathered a bad reputation for being a place where the worst criminals are send to be interrogated.

Grand Staircase is proably the largest district in the city it reffers to the middle class housing away from all of the industry, its has tight passageways traveling around like a maze despite the facade of utopia its the district most at risk of soulfire poisoning. The district is heavyly guarded but even that doesnt stop most of petty theftf and pickpokets that live in heavy crowds of this place. Most of the city's trade happenes here.

Templehof the worhip district of the city build here are many temples zigurats and altars dedicated to snake gods 

Golden hills is the district where all of the most expensive of buildings rest most notably Halls of Parliment,Mannor of Berchan,Imperial zoo and Zerian headquarters where all agents and secret police are trainied
