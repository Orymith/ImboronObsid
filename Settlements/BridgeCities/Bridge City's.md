In the realm of [[Imboron]], the Bridge Cities stand as a testament to ambition and prosperity. Once divided by a vast expanse of sea, two flourishing cities, [[Astoria]] and [[Marisville]], expanded relentlessly until both shores were united by a grand causeway—a colossal bridge. Atop the bridge, a bustling metropolis thrives, governed by the influential [[Guild of Prosperous Traders]].The guild, having overthrown the original kings two centuries ago, holds the reins of power and shapes the city's fate. The Bridge Cities are now governed by oligarchs, and while wealth and opportunity abound for some, many inhabitants find themselves ensnared in the clutches of poverty.

### Government

Oligarchs: The Oligarchs, comprising esteemed members of the Guild of Prosperous Traders, are the ruling elite of the Bridge Cities. They are the wealthiest and most influential individuals, holding sway over trade, commerce, and various sectors of the city's economy. 

Council of Oligarchs: The council serves as the primary decision-making body within the guild. The Oligarchs convene to discuss and determine matters of governance, legislation, trade policies, and other significant aspects of city affairs. Guild 

Hierarchy: The [[Guild of Prosperous Traders]] is structured with a hierarchy, where members rise through the ranks based on their achievements, contributions to the guild's prosperity, and wealth. The higher the rank, the greater the influence and privileges bestowed upon them.

1. The Guild of Prosperous Traders: The guild plays a central role in organizing and overseeing trade affairs. Comprising influential merchants, they establish trade routes, negotiate agreements, and ensure fair practices among traders.

The Celestial Comet (approx. 2000 years ago): A celestial comet descended upon Imboron, causing a cataclysmic upheaval that receded the sea between Astoria and Marisville, creating a land bridge that would eventually unite the cities. 

The Rise of the Guild (approx. 1800 years ago): Ambitious traders from both cities established trade routes, and among them, the Guild of Prosperous Traders emerged, unifying the wealth and power of the traders. 

Overthrow of Kings (approx. 500 years ago): The Guild of Prosperous Traders orchestrated an uprising, resulting in the overthrow of the ruling kings and the establishment of an oligarchic rule.

Construction of the Bridge (approx. 400 years ago): As the cities expanded, a grand bridge was constructed to connect Astoria and Marisville, becoming a symbol of their unity and prosperity. 

Prosperity and Disparity (approx. 200 years ago): The Bridge Cities flourished under the governance of the Guild of Prosperous Traders, experiencing economic prosperity, but also witnessing a widening gap between the wealthy elite and the impoverished populace. Challenges and Dissent (present times): Growing disparity and dissatisfaction among the impoverished inhabitants have led to occasional dissent and protests against the oligarchic rule, shaping the present-day state of the Bridge Cities.
