### Leiga: Jewel of the Eastern Sea

#### Founding and Early History

Leiga, a vibrant and bustling port city, stands proudly on the eastern coast of the [[First Empire Of Man]]. Its foundation dates back to the early years of the Empire's expansion, shortly after the end of the Demon War. Founded by Emperor [[Thorles Loray]] in 4IA (Imperial Age), Leiga was established as a key maritime hub to facilitate trade and bolster the Empire's naval prowess.

Built upon the ruins of an ancient, pre-Imperial settlement, Leiga quickly grew from a small fishing village into a thriving city. The strategic location of its natural harbor, sheltered by rocky cliffs and bordered by fertile plains, made it an ideal spot for both trade and defense. With the Empire's support, Leiga's docks were expanded, its walls fortified, and its streets paved with the ambition of becoming the Empire's gateway to the eastern seas.

#### Notable Locations

**1. The Harbor of Stars:** The heart of Leiga's commerce and activity, the Harbor of Stars is named for the way its waters glitter under the night sky. This expansive port is constantly abuzz with the sounds of sailors, merchants, and dockworkers. Ships from all corners of the known world dock here, bringing exotic goods, spices, and news from distant lands. The harbor is overseen by the Dockmaster's Guild, which ensures the smooth operation of trade and the safety of the harbor.

**2. The Grand Lighthouse:** Standing sentinel at the entrance of the harbor, the Grand Lighthouse is both a navigational aid and a symbol of Leiga's enduring strength. Built from white marble and crowned with a brilliant beacon, the lighthouse guides ships safely to shore and is visible for miles around. It is maintained by the Order of the Lightkeepers, a group dedicated to preserving maritime safety and aiding ships in distress.

**3. The Sea King's Palace:** Perched on a cliff overlooking the harbor, the Sea King's Palace is the residence of Leiga's ruling governor, known as the Sea King. This opulent palace is a blend of Imperial grandeur and maritime elegance, with sweeping views of the ocean and the city below. The Sea King, appointed by the Emperor, governs Leiga with a firm but fair hand, ensuring that the city's prosperity continues to flourish.

**4. The Market of Tides:** Leiga's bustling marketplace is a sensory feast of sights, sounds, and smells. Here, merchants hawk their wares, ranging from fresh seafood and rare spices to fine silks and intricate jewelry. The Market of Tides is also a melting pot of cultures, with traders from distant lands sharing stories and customs, making it a vibrant and cosmopolitan hub.

**5. The Temple of Melora:** As a city by the sea, Leiga holds a deep reverence for Melora, the goddess of the sea and storms. The Temple of Melora, located near the harbor, is a place of worship and sanctuary for sailors and fishermen. The temple's priests offer blessings for safe voyages and conduct rituals to appease the sea's wrath, ensuring calm waters and bountiful catches.

**6. The Mariners' Guild Hall:** A vital institution in Leiga, the Mariners' Guild Hall serves as a center for the city's sailors and shipbuilders. This grand building is adorned with intricate carvings depicting legendary sea voyages and maritime battles. The Guild Hall offers training, support, and camaraderie to its members, fostering a strong sense of community among those who make their living on the sea.
