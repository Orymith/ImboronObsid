#### Overview

[[Drorgal Niz]], often referred to as the Barren Wasteland, is a harsh and unforgiving region located to the West of the Empire. It is a desolate expanse of rocky plains, jagged cliffs, and parched earth, where life struggles to take root and only the strongest and most resilient creatures can survive. The landscape is dotted with the remnants of ancient civilizations, their ruins standing as silent witnesses to the passage of time and the unforgiving nature of the land.

#### Geography and Climate

The terrain of Drorgal Niz is rugged and inhospitable, characterized by vast stretches of arid plains interspersed with towering rock formations and deep canyons. The climate is harsh, with scorching days and freezing nights, and little to no rainfall throughout the year. The few water sources that do exist are often hidden in underground caverns or guarded by fierce creatures.

#### The Inhabitants

Despite its barren nature, Drorgal Niz is not entirely devoid of life. The region is home to a variety of hardy and adaptive species, including:

**1. [[RemoteBackup/Races of Imboron/Ork-kind races|Ork-kind races]]:** The primary inhabitants of Drorgal Niz are the orcs, who have adapted to the harsh environment over generations. They are divided into several clans, each with its own unique characteristics and traditions. The three main clans, Clan Thundertusk, Clan Bloodfang, and Clan Moonshadow, are the most prominent and influential in the region.

**2. Kobolds, Goblins, and Bugbears:** These smaller humanoid species have also carved out a niche for themselves in Drorgal Niz, often living in symbiosis with the orc clans or forming their own independent communities. They are known for their resourcefulness and ability to survive in the harshest conditions.

**3. Wildlife:** The wildlife of Drorgal Niz is equally adapted to the extreme environment. Predatory beasts, venomous serpents, and elusive prey animals roam the land, each perfectly suited to the barren landscape.

#### The Tribes and Clans

The orc clans of Drorgal Niz are the dominant cultural and political forces in the region. The most notable clans include:

**1. [[Clan Thundertusk]]:** Renowned for their deep connection with the elements and mastery of [[elemental magic]], Clan Thundertusk orcs are stoic and wise, often serving as spiritual leaders. Their tattoos, adorned with lightning symbols, signify their affinity with the storm.

**2. [[Clan Bloodfang]]:** Known for their martial prowess and combat strategy, Clan Bloodfang is a ferocious and battle-hardened group. Their warriors, bearing fangs and tribal tattoos, symbolize their ruthless nature and deep sense of honor and strength.

**3. [[Clan Moonshadow]]:** The most enigmatic of the clans, Clan Moonshadow orcs are masters of dark and mysterious [[magic]]. Skilled in shadow manipulation, illusion, and stealth, they are often seen as cunning and secretive, their lunar tattoos symbolizing their connection to the moon.

#### The Capital: [[Gromlok Thar]]

Gromlok Thar, the capital of Drorgal Niz, is a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of the orc-kind. It is a sprawling city built into the cliffs and canyons, with structures carved from the living rock and fortified with crude but effective defenses. The city is governed by the [[Council of the Three Tribes]], representing Clan Thundertusk, Clan Bloodfang, and Clan Moonshadow. This council ensures the stability and unity of the orc-kind in the face of external threats and internal conflicts.

#### Cultural Significance

Drorgal Niz holds significant cultural and spiritual importance for its inhabitants. The harsh environment has forged a strong sense of community and resilience among the orc-kind, who view their survival in such a challenging land as a mark of their strength and determination. The ancient ruins scattered across the wasteland are revered as sacred sites, offering glimpses into the region's mysterious past and the enduring legacy of its people.

In the current year of 60IA, Drorgal Niz remains a land of mystery and danger, where the line between survival and extinction is razor-thin. Those who venture into its barren expanse do so with the knowledge that they are entering a world where only the strongest endure, and the secrets of the past lie buried beneath the unforgiving sands.
